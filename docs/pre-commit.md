# Pre-commit

It is a multi-language package manager for pre-commit hooks. You specify a list of hooks you want and pre-commit manages the installation and execution of any hook written in any language before every commit. pre-commit is specifically designed to not require root access.

## How to run pre-commit

Run the below commnad from the git repo root to set up the git hook scripts into your git hooks. It will be installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit

```bash
pre-commit install
```

now pre-commit will run automatically on git commit. Usually, it runs only for the changed files. Its good to run the hooks against all the files when adding new hooks. To manually run all pre-commit hooks on a repo, use below -

```bash
# to run hooks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# to run individual hook
pre-commit run <hook_id>
```

Once you have pre-commit installed, adding pre-commit plugins to your project is done with the .pre-commit-config.yaml configuration file. You can generate a very basic configuration using `pre-commit sample-config`. Every time you clone a project using pre-commit running pre-commit install should always be the first thing you do.
